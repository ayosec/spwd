spwd 0.1
https://github.com/ayosec/spwd

ShorterPWD prints the current path, trimming parent names to adjust the width
to the specified width.

Usage:

    spwd [OPTIONS]

    PS1='\u@\h $(spwd -m 40)\$ '


Options:

    -P            Print physical path (getcwd(3)).
    -L            Print logical path ($PWD),
    -m [width]    Set target width for the printed path.
    -a [path]     Path of the aliases file.


Using Aliases:

    spwd can replace a path with an alias found in the file indicated with -a.

    The file contains one alias per line, separated with a '='.
    Spaces around '=' are ignored.

    For example, with this file:

        (My Projects)=/here/are/my/projects
        (Work)=/home/user/content/work

    spwd will print "(Work)/foo" for the path "/home/user/content/work/foo".
